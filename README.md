# Easy-Fit
Nutrition and Diet Planner
 This project highlights my proficiency in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and provides an intuitive platform for efficient diet management. Here's a glimpse of what it offers:

ðŸ”¹ Features and Functionality ðŸ”¹
- User Registration and Login: Ensuring a secure system for personalized user experiences.
- Diet Tracker: Adding and monitoring various foods with detailed information on calories, carbs, protein, and vitamins.
- BMI Calculator: Displaying the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user inputs.
- Personalized Diet Plans: Tailoring plans for athletes, diabetes patients, heart patients, and more.
- General Health Info: Offering tips for maintaining a healthy BMI and diet guidance.

Excited to showcase the Object-Oriented Programming concepts covered, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, modularity, and code reusability. 

ðŸŽ¨ User Interface and Effectiveness ðŸŽ¨
- Clear and intuitive menus for seamless navigation.
- Interactive and responsive features allowing users to calculate BMI and access customized diet plans.
- Detailed information display for easy tracking of user data and diet summaries.

This project has been a significant learning experience for me, especially with no prior coding background. Grateful for the guidance of Sir Adil Khan and the contribution of Hassam ur Rehman in making this project a success.
